        We are happy to share all [plasmids](https://github.com/rasilab/nugent_2024/blob/main/data/supplementary_tables/table_s2_list_of_plasmids.csv) 
        and most [cell lines](https://github.com/rasilab/nugent_2024/blob/main/data/supplementary_tables/table_s4_list_of_celllines.csv) 
        developed as part of this paper. 
        We are unable to ship cell line pools with integrated plasmid libraries 
        since they need large volume culturing to maintain library diversity.
