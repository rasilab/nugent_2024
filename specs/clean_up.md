# Repository Cleanup and Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the work done to clean up and improve the reproducibility of the nugent_2024 repository for the Nature Methods manuscript "Decoding post-transcriptional regulatory networks by RNA-linked CRISPR screening in human cells".

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Riboseq Analysis Refactoring (Figures 5f, 5g)

**Original Issue**: Large, complex Jupyter notebook with unnecessary code and no source data export

**User Request**: 
- Refactor `analyze_transcriptome_coverage.r` to keep only PDF generation code
- Save source data as CSV files for figures 5f and 5g
- Update README.md with proper links

**Implementation**:
- Converted notebook to streamlined R script focusing only on figure generation
- Added automatic GTF annotation download from NCBI FTP
- Generated figures 5f (metadensity) and 5g (JUN/MYC ribosome profiling)
- Exported source data to CSV files
- Updated run_everything.sh to include riboseq workflow
- Fixed file extension from `.r` to `.R`

**Key Mistakes Made**:
1. Initially tried to download and extract GTF file locally instead of reading directly from URL
2. Created source_data directory in wrong location (analysis/riboseq/scripts level)
3. Wrong line numbers in README links due to code changes

**Final Result**: Clean R script that generates figures and exports source data, integrated into main workflow

### 2. Figure 2a Notebook Conversion

**User Request**: Convert Jupyter notebook to R script and update README links

**Implementation**:
- Converted `plot_fig2_polysomes.ipynb` to `plot_fig2_polysomes.R`
- Updated README.md with proper figure and code links
- Added to run_everything.sh workflow
- Updated summary section to include polysome profiling figures directory

**Result**: Consistent R script workflow for Figure 2a

### 3. Figure 4 Link Corrections

**Original Issue**: Incorrect figure file paths and missing panels in README

**User Request**: Fix links for figures 4b, 4c, 4d with correct file paths

**Corrections Made**:
- Figure 4b: Added both panels (alphabetic + hits jitter)
- Figures 4c, 4d: Combined as they're in same volcano plot file
- Fixed code line numbers to match actual `ggsave()` calls

**Key Mistakes Made**:
1. Initially had wrong figure file names
2. Wrong line numbers pointing to data processing instead of plot generation

### 4. Source Data Accuracy Issues

**Critical Issue Identified**: Source data not matching actual plotted data

**User Request**: Fix Figure 5c to save data that's actually plotted

**Problem**: Script was saving aggregated `mean_data` but plot used individual `plot_data` with `geom_jitter`

**Fix**: Changed to save the individual sgRNA-level data that's actually visualized

**Lesson**: Always verify source data matches what's being plotted, not intermediate calculations

### 5. Source Data Format Improvements

**User Request**: Reformat Figure 5g source data to wide format with essential columns only

**Original Format**: Long format with many unnecessary columns (seqnames, strand, etc.)

**Improved Format**: 
- Wide format with samples as columns
- Only essential data: position + ribosome coverage scores
- Clean column names: sgfluc/sggcn1, dmso/hht conditions

**Result**: Compact, user-friendly source data files

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Source Data Validation
- **Always verify** that source data matches the actual plotted data
- Check if plot uses raw data, aggregated data, or transformed data
- Don't assume intermediate calculations are what gets plotted

### 2. Code Link Accuracy
- Line numbers should point to `ggsave()` calls, not data processing
- Update README links whenever code structure changes
- Test links to ensure they point to correct locations

### 3. Data Format Considerations
- Wide format often more user-friendly than long format for source data
- Remove unnecessary technical columns that don't aid reproducibility
- Consider file size and usability when designing output format

### 4. File Naming Conventions
- Use uppercase `.R` extension for R scripts (not `.r`)
- Maintain consistent naming across the repository
- Update all references when changing file names

### 5. Workflow Integration
- Add new scripts to `run_everything.sh` in logical order
- Update summary sections to include new output directories
- Ensure preprocessing workflows run before analysis scripts

### 6. Git Commit Practices
- Don't include Claude attribution in commit messages
- Focus commit messages on what changed and why
- Group related changes in single commits

## Best Practices Established

1. **Script Structure**: Keep analysis scripts focused on figure generation only
2. **Data Export**: Always export source data that matches plotted data
3. **Documentation**: Maintain accurate README links with specific line numbers
4. **Reproducibility**: Include data download and preprocessing in workflows
5. **Format Consistency**: Use wide format for source data when appropriate
6. **Code Quality**: Remove unnecessary code and focus on essential functionality

## Repository State After Cleanup

- Streamlined riboseq analysis with proper source data export
- Consistent R script workflows across all figures
- Accurate README links pointing to correct code and data
- Clean, user-friendly source data formats
- Integrated workflows in run_everything.sh
- All figures reproducible with proper dependencies

This cleanup significantly improved the repository's reproducibility and usability for other researchers.
